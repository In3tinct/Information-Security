This script could be run as a background process(Runs every 5 min.s, you can change it if you want), It relieves from the pain of opening hackerone again and again to check if any new program has been added. 

If any new bounty programs are added to HackerOne 
forum, it would automatically open an alert box 
and open the hackerone link in browser.

Platform: Linux
Scripting: Python
